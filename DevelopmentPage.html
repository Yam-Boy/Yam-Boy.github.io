				The last five years of my life consists of me entering 4th form of my high school, Bridgeport high,<br>
				to the continuation of my university life as a second year student at The University of Technology.<br>
				During my adolescent years I spent a lot of time contemplating life and ruminating on the thought<br>
				of self-improvement, though this was more so in an effort to be acknowledged by my peers rather<br>
				than any benefits I would expereince after reaping the fruits of my labor, labors which included.

				<li>Reading</li>
				<li>Meditation</li>
				<li>Creating Art</li>
				<li>Routine Excercise</li>
				</font></ul>
				<font color="fabec1">
				This period of improving myself allowed me to develop my self-discipline to higher degree than it<br>
				was previously. Secondly my creativity as an individual was also bolstered due to the struggle of<br>
				having to create new interesting pieces of art consistently. Finally, the amount new content that I<br>
				was reading increased my vocabulary, comprehensive ability, developed my critical thinking skills<br>
				and decision-making skills. With all this in consideration.I can confidently say<br>
				that my strengths are:
				<ul><font color="ee233d">
				<li>My Intellect</li>
				<li>My Discipline</li>
				<li>My Creativity</li>

	<h3 align="center"><font color="19193b">4: Achieve Your Goals</font></h3>
	
	This chapter of the book focuses on the importance of goal setting in an individuals life<br>
	in order to achieve their goals. If you set a goal within reason and work earnestly to<br>
	achieve it you will come to realise that you are able to work more effciently towards it <br>
	as you now have a driving force pushing you to achieve what it is you set out to do. With<br> 
	this, figuring out what it is you want to achieve is one of the most important aspects to <br>
	becoming successful.
	
	<h3 align="center"><font color="19193b">5: The Proper Use of Time</font></h3>
	
	On the road to success, each step taken is very important as they are the building blocks<br>
	for your next step forward. Each step leads into the other, much like how each moment<br>
	spent on a task contributes to your future success.<br>
	With this in mind, we must ensure that we use our time efficiently and sieze the day at<br>
	every oppurtunity as what we do now determines what we can achieve later on. We must<br>
	then take it upon ourselves to determine the most effective way forward and press forward<br>
	on that path.
	
	<h3 align="center"><font color="19193b">6: Surround Yourself with the Best People</font></h3>
	
	Proverbs 27:17 proclaims, "Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend."<br>
	This statement received from the bible, is used to educate one's self on the value of having a good<br>
	social group. You must ensure that you surround yourself with people who will test, challenge and<br>
	push you to higher heights.<br>
	"No man is an island; No man stands alone. Each man's joy is a joy to me; Each man's grief is my own."<br>
	, this verse taken from a christian hymn, shows us the importance of relationships, but above that are<br>
	relationships that exist to improve both parties involved.
	
	<h3 align="center"><font color="19193b">7: Be A Life-long Learner</font></h3>
	
	The benefits of "Formal Education" cannot be denounced as it serves to educate the larger population,<br>
	but many individuals neglect the pursuit of educating themselves outside of traditional schooling, thereafter<br>
	its completion. "Self-Education" is necessary for the continuous development of an individual physically,<br>
	emotionally, intellectual and in regards to their maturation. Thus in a effort to avoid stagnation in life<br>
	post formal education, one should: read, explore, discuss, seek counsel and learn by learn by whatever<br>
	means presented to you.

	<h3 align="center"><font color="19193b">Self-Reflection</font></h3>
	
	Having read this I consider that in some aspects of my life I fall short.<br>
	I am not particlarly proficient at planning for the achievement of goals.<br>
	I tend to procrastinate and not effeciently use my time as wisely as I could<br>
	My peer group may not be the best at pushing me to achieving accolades greater<br>
	than I have previously.<br>
	But, I do find my self resonating with the idea of life-long learning and the<br>
	pursuit of knowledge used to most benefits one's life.<br>
	However, scrutinizing every aspect of my life to find what does or does not work<br>
	is not the optimal way to live.<br>
	I am thankful for what I have and what I am capable of and I will strive achieve<br>
	more, than what I can right now, keeping in mind the lessons from this book.
